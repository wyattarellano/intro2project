A bank is a (listof branches)

A branch is an interface that offers the following services:
1. init: -> (void)
2. add-account: string number -> (void)

A bank account is a structure, (make-account number client),
with  a balance and an owner.

A bank client is a structure, (make-client string (listof account)),
with a name and a list of accounts.

;;Tests
;;As you can see, the accounts made using the same name, do not affect other accounts
;;in other branches. This means, that our tests illustrate that changes to one
;;branch do not affect a different branch.
