              ;;The Vector Interval starts as [0...(sub1 (vector-length vector))]. During each loop the function
              ;;checks if the (vector-ref vector index) is not equal to the desired number and the index is not equal
              ;;to -1. If these are false, then the loop will terminate. Otherwise the function checks if the number
              ;;is less than or greater than the (vector-ref vector mid-index). If the number is less than
              ;;(vector-ref vector mid-index), high is changed to (sub1 mid-index), then mid-index is changed
              ;;to (quotient high 2). This means that the interval has become smaller because low has stayed the same
              ;;and high has became a smaller value than it was previously. This means that the function is making progress towards termination
              ;;due to the interval becoming smaller. If the number is greater than (vector-ref vector mid-index), low is changed to
              ;;(add1 mid-index), then mid-index is changed to (quotient (+ low high) 2). This means that the interval has
              ;;became smaller because high has stayed the same and low has became closer to high. This means that the function is
              ;;making progress towards termination due to the interval becoming smaller. Eventually the interval will become
              ;;empty or (= (vector-ref vector index) num). When the interval is empty, the loop will terminate because index will
              ;;equal -1. When the driver (= (vector-ref vector index) num) is true, the number has been found, so the loop will terminate.
